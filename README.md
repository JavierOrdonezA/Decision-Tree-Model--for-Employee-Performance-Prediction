# Decision Tree Model for Employee Performance Prediction

## Project Description
In this workshop, titled "Problem Solving with Decision Trees," we explore the application of decision trees to predict employee burnout based on various factors like education, previous job roles, and salary. Using a dataset that captures attributes related to employee performance and attrition, this project guides through the process of loading, preparing data, performing hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the performance of the decision tree model.

## Workshop Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset to be used in the analysis.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare and clean the dataset for modeling.
3. **Data Exploration** : Studying data distribution and correlations
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize decision tree parameters using cross-validation.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the best model to predict employee performance outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language used for data manipulation and modeling.
- Jupyter Notebook: Platform for executing Python code interactively.
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Getting Started
To run this project:
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook to walk through the analysis step by step.
